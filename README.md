### Election Audit Summary
The script can be refactored to deliver a variety of results for any election, including local, state and national. The only limitations that exist are based on the raw data provided. 
The script can be modified with a decision statement to determine how the county vote was cast by gender. The script can also be modified to determine things like voter turnout based on age, gender, race, etc. This information can be useful when candidates or officials are determining the needs of a specific area.
